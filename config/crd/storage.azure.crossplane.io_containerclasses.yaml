                are deleted, and what will happen to their underlying external resource
                when they are deleted. The "Delete" policy causes the managed resource
                to be deleted when its bound resource claim is deleted, and in turn
                causes the external resource to be deleted when its managed resource
                is deleted. The "Retain" policy causes the managed resource to be
                retained, in binding phase "Released", when its resource claim is
                deleted, and in turn causes the external resource to be retained when
                its managed resource is deleted. The "Delete" policy is used when
                no policy is specified.
